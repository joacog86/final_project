# Final Project - ISP Churn Predictor

## Churn Predictor Project

The following project is about an ISP (Internet Service Provider) with customer data.
The goal is to generate 3 ML models to predict churn, and will use 3 classification models.

## DataSet
Data corresponds to a fictional ISP/Telco in USA with a total of 7043 customers. There are many different files that concatenate on the Customer_id.

## Prediction Models

The models used for the classification problem are
* Logaritmic Regression
* KNN
* Decision trees

These models are later Hyperparameter Tuned.
At the end of the Notebok, there are some conclusion and Next Steps recommendations for the ISP to prevent churn.
